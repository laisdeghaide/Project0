Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
# project0


This project contains 5 HTML files: index, program, channels, conf, and info.
This project contains also 5 CSS files to bring up to the HTML pages a more aesthetically pleasing face.

In all pages, you will find a navbar containing all five writeups linkable to every page, and a footer containing my e-mail work and the Copywrite, simulating a real website. In the navbar, I used an unordered list. In all pages, I inserted bootstrap stylesheet to make it a better-looking page.

In index.html, I simply describe what the site is for, and what you'll find in which page.

In program.html, I created a table with 3 columns: 1st with the name of the course, 2nd with who offers that directs to the course, 3rd with a summary of all courses.

In channels.html, I used bootstrap component cards, where I put some YouTubers channels.

In conf.html, I used a bootstrap grid to insert the conferences and hackathons summary and clickable link.

info.html is an "about me" page with 2 images.

All the 5 CSS contains the main.css, which has the components of the basic style that I used in the pages. In this CSS file I used mobile-responsive @media query, 5 SCSS variables, and 2 SCSS nesting.

The program.html also contains courses.css that contains the table style and also uses an SCSS variable.

The channels.html also contains chan.css that contains the cards and buttons style and it uses SCSS inheritance.

The conf.html contains chan.css to style the buttons like the in the youtube channels page, and grid.css to style the grid columns.

The info.html contains inform.css that styles the 2 images and the text.
